that &amp;ldquo;the future started 2 days ago.&amp;rdquo; He was referring to GPT-4o and how
in another class of his several students came forward saying that, despite the
anti-AI measures that had been implemented in various courses, they still were
able to &amp;ldquo;cheat&amp;rdquo; with artificial intelligence and not be caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While his lecture had several points, the core was this: AI is the future, and
we need to rule it so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rule us. Being a neophobe will hurt you
incredibly, and will ultimately leave you behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fuck It, It's All Me</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 08:16:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve had my blog separated into two different pages:
&lt;code&gt;/posts/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/personal/&lt;/code&gt;. Posts was where my more general, public-friendly
stuff would go, and personal is my archive for all my personal ramblings. But
you know what, fuck it. It&amp;rsquo;s all me. Every post on here is me, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a
personal rambling or it&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how to do something in tech. It&amp;rsquo;s all me.
If you just want one, you can go ahead and use the two links at the top to
filter your experience. But this site is me, so everything on it is me. I&amp;rsquo;m not
going to pretend like I&amp;rsquo;m partitioned off into differrent people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Oops! All Parasocial!</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/oops-all-parasocial/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 10:50:45 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/oops-all-parasocial/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://intangiblematter.github.io/media/2023/05/oops-all-parasocial/parasociallll.GIF" alt="Jesus Christ Parasocial You need to log off"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly a secret that I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to make friendships in
life. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at reading social signals, I&amp;rsquo;m always direct about
things that most people are at least &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; awkward about, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing
about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that
&lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice and not that they&amp;rsquo;re busy or something.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Heat Is Horrible</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 08:25:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s mid May and the temperature has suddenly shot up by about 10 degrees
where I live. If you lived in Ontario or something, this would probably be
normal, but I live in southwest BC. The temperature getting above or below 8-12
degrees is &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, especially this suddenly. Or I guess it isn&amp;rsquo;t weird, just
miserable. Another sucky part of it is that my town isn&amp;rsquo;t frequently this hot
so most buildings don&amp;rsquo;t have air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>That One Person Who Presses All the Buttons</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:12:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have that one person who just somehow perfectly presses the buttons on
all of your insecurities without even knowing it? That person who just seems
so untouchable and perfect that their mere existence seems like some cosmic
joke at your expense? Even if you know they&amp;rsquo;re still human, and that they also
deal with issues like humans do, it just feels like they&amp;rsquo;ve figured out a
method for hiding all of their struggles perfectly?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

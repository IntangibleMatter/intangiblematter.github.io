While his lecture had several points, the core was this: AI is the future, and we need to rule it so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rule us.</description></item><item><title>Fuck It, It's All Me</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 08:16:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</guid><description>For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve had my blog separated into two different pages: /posts/ and /personal/. Posts was where my more general, public-friendly stuff would go, and personal is my archive for all my personal ramblings. But you know what, fuck it. It&amp;rsquo;s all me. Every post on here is me, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a personal rambling or it&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how to do something in tech. It&amp;rsquo;s all me.</description></item><item><title>Oops! All Parasocial!</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/oops-all-parasocial/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 10:50:45 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/oops-all-parasocial/</guid><description>So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly a secret that I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to make friendships in life. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at reading social signals, I&amp;rsquo;m always direct about things that most people are at least somewhat awkward about, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that obviously someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep that I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice and not that they&amp;rsquo;re busy or something.</description></item><item><title>The Heat Is Horrible</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 08:25:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</guid><description>So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s mid May and the temperature has suddenly shot up by about 10 degrees where I live. If you lived in Ontario or something, this would probably be normal, but I live in southwest BC. The temperature getting above or below 8-12 degrees is weird, especially this suddenly. Or I guess it isn&amp;rsquo;t weird, just miserable. Another sucky part of it is that my town isn&amp;rsquo;t frequently this hot so most buildings don&amp;rsquo;t have air conditioning.</description></item><item><title>That One Person Who Presses All the Buttons</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:12:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</guid><description>Do you have that one person who just somehow perfectly presses the buttons on all of your insecurities without even knowing it? That person who just seems so untouchable and perfect that their mere existence seems like some cosmic joke at your expense? Even if you know they&amp;rsquo;re still human, and that they also deal with issues like humans do, it just feels like they&amp;rsquo;ve figured out a method for hiding all of their struggles perfectly?</description></item></channel></rss>

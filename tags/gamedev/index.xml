meetup! I basically got on a bus &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; after school to get down to the ferry,
then I went into Vancouer and&amp;hellip; ate food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also all of this was with my friend &lt;a href="https://visu.do"&gt;River&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re cool.
Check them out. Without whom I probably would&amp;rsquo;ve been having an anxiety attack
for the whole trip so&amp;hellip; thanks, Riv!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we ate, we went down to the Skytrain and went down to the place where the
meetup was happening. We arrived half an hour early, and while we were waiting
for the doors to open two things happened:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Footpedal: A FOSS Audio Engine for Games</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/12/footpedal-a-foss-audio-engine-for-games/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 10:01:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/12/footpedal-a-foss-audio-engine-for-games/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; dynamic audio in games. Being a game developer, I want to add it to my
own projects. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m broke and all existing solutions are expensive
to use (at least without a giant splash screen when you boot up the game.)
Obviously, being a programmer myself, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to write an audio
engine on my own. This is, of course, a completely giant task, and I am not
amazing at programming complex systems, especially at lower levels, so I
pretty much gave up. Before I gave up, though, I mentioned this project to a
friend of mine, &lt;a href="https://visu.do"&gt;River&lt;/a&gt;, who promptly didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it
and continued &lt;em&gt;rewriting the JVM&lt;/em&gt;. A few weeks back, though, they ended up
taking another look at the project, and we started working on it together.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Game Engines [ARCHIVE]</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2021/07/12/game-engines-archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 10:01:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2021/07/12/game-engines-archive/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE NOTE: this is an archive from my original blog. It was my only post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before we begin: A game engine is a tool which is used to create games. It
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;usually has a user interface and a scripting language (a specialized programming
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;language unique to the engine) of some sort.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A game _framework_ is a library of code which can be added to your code so it&amp;#39;s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;easier to make a game. These generally require substantially more knowledge and
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;coding skill.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as many of you know, &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.itch.io"&gt;I like to make games.&lt;/a&gt;
A lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve published four games (as
of writing) and have created several more. However, my choice of game engine
hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been consistent. The first engine I tried to use was, as is many
people&amp;rsquo;s first choice, Unity. My time with this engine was short, and I had a
great deal of trouble trying to grock how it works.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

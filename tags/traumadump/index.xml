&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly a secret that I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to make friendships in
life. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at reading social signals, I&amp;rsquo;m always direct about
things that most people are at least &lt;em>somewhat&lt;/em> awkward about, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing
about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that
&lt;em>obviously&lt;/em> someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice and not that they&amp;rsquo;re busy or something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm Fine: a Short Film</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>&lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m Fine&lt;/em> is a short film that I wrote, recorded, and filmed almost entirely
by myself in late April of 2023 for my high school&amp;rsquo;s film fest. I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas
for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the
first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t
be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects
of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while
resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically
justify why they exist by the mirror.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

listening to me talk,) you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt.
Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described &lt;em>Oscar-losing&lt;/em> filmmaker. He makes animated
films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful
stories I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, &lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day&lt;/em>, is an
hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their
limits. In it, you hear the story of Bill, a man suffering from an unspecified
mental disease, and through the film you experience some of his life from what
we can only assume to be his perspective as he goes through some difficult
events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm Fine: a Short Film</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>&lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m Fine&lt;/em> is a short film that I wrote, recorded, and filmed almost entirely
by myself in late April of 2023 for my high school&amp;rsquo;s film fest. I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas
for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the
first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t
be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects
of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while
resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically
justify why they exist by the mirror.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Brief Hantiplad About Everything Everywhere All At Once</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/22/a-brief-hantiplad-about-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:51:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/22/a-brief-hantiplad-about-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I finally got to watch that movie everyone was talking about last year. It&amp;rsquo;s
honestly &lt;em>even better&lt;/em> than everyone says. The effects were &lt;em>amazing&lt;/em>, the
writing was &lt;em>fantastic&lt;/em>, and the actors were all&amp;hellip; *&lt;em>chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss&lt;/em>*.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="caption">Our deadpan-hyper chaotic-evil queen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favourite character was &lt;em>easily&lt;/em> Jobu Tupekai. She&amp;rsquo;s honestly everything I
aspire to be. A cool, nihilistic, reality warping, amazing looking young adult
who created an object that can destroy the most powerful people somewhat out
of &lt;em>boredom&lt;/em>. She even &lt;em>moves&lt;/em> how I want to. Just a little bit crazy, and like
a cutesy cartoon character was given a few doses of evil maniac. People who
move in an animated way are the &lt;em>best&lt;/em>. And the head ticking to swap between
dimensions&amp;hellip; UGH! It&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant film, and I loved all the characters.
Waymond was adorable and we all need someone like him in our lives, Evelyn was
&lt;em>such&lt;/em> a compelling character, and it was all.. ugh. &lt;em>so amazing&lt;/em>!!!1!1&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

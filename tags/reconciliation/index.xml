&lt;p>Reconciliation is an interesting topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also an &lt;em>incredibly&lt;/em> complicated one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For any of you in the audience who aren&amp;rsquo;t Canadian, Truth and Reconciliation is
an ongoing effort by the Government of Canada, and to varying degrees Canadian
citizens, to make amends for the horrors enacted upon the First Peoples of
Canada during colonization and the Residential School system. Its effectiveness
has been&amp;hellip; varied, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s doing the best work it can, considering
the circumstances.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

specifically &lt;em&gt;World of Tomorrow Part Two: The Burden of Other People&amp;rsquo;s
Thoughts&lt;/em&gt;. As per usual, I was crying by the ending of it, which is completely
expected if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/"&gt;my love for emotionally vulnerable media&lt;/a&gt;,
and I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed how I feel about it. Genuinely as long as I can remember
I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with making and keeping friends, and have usually been (though
much more so since the start of my teenage years) somewhat lonely. I&amp;rsquo;ve found
comfort in the emotions I find in other people&amp;rsquo;s work, whether that be &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s
Such a Beautiful Day&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fuck It, It's All Me</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 08:16:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve had my blog separated into two different pages:
&lt;code&gt;/posts/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/personal/&lt;/code&gt;. Posts was where my more general, public-friendly
stuff would go, and personal is my archive for all my personal ramblings. But
you know what, fuck it. It&amp;rsquo;s all me. Every post on here is me, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a
personal rambling or it&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how to do something in tech. It&amp;rsquo;s all me.
If you just want one, you can go ahead and use the two links at the top to
filter your experience. But this site is me, so everything on it is me. I&amp;rsquo;m not
going to pretend like I&amp;rsquo;m partitioned off into differrent people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don Hertzfeldt, Hangar, and the Desire to Be Human</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any amount of time talking to me (or, more accurately,
listening to me talk,) you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt.
Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described &lt;em&gt;Oscar-losing&lt;/em&gt; filmmaker. He makes animated
films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful
stories I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day&lt;/em&gt;, is an
hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their
limits. In it, you hear the story of Bill, a man suffering from an unspecified
mental disease, and through the film you experience some of his life from what
we can only assume to be his perspective as he goes through some difficult
events.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Rare Moments You Feel Like You're Real</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:10:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a song that I like. Might be good to listen to with this post. Idk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how some people feel like they&amp;rsquo;re the only real person in the world?&lt;br&gt;
I have the opposite problem.&lt;br&gt;
To some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a &amp;ldquo;teenager&amp;rdquo; is
&lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations.
Whether it&amp;rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to
isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to
find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone
with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts. Even if this is a perfectly valid
way to exist, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as such. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be out hanging out with friends, discovering myself, and just
taking time to &lt;em&gt;be a teen&lt;/em&gt;. But I don&amp;rsquo;t. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I ever really take
the time to just be a teen, because I&amp;rsquo;m too busy being &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;mature for my age&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; or
desperately clinging on to the memories of the times before my mental health
issues were overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My First Fullindie Meetup</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/06/my-first-fullindie-meetup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 23:27:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/06/my-first-fullindie-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on the ferry ride home from my very first FullIndie
meetup! I basically got on a bus &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; after school to get down to the ferry,
then I went into Vancouer and&amp;hellip; ate food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also all of this was with my friend &lt;a href="https://visu.do"&gt;River&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re cool.
Check them out. Without whom I probably would&amp;rsquo;ve been having an anxiety attack
for the whole trip so&amp;hellip; thanks, Riv!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we ate, we went down to the Skytrain and went down to the place where the
meetup was happening. We arrived half an hour early, and while we were waiting
for the doors to open two things happened:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mirrors</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 13:59:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like the people we get along best with are always, to some degree, mirrors of ourselves.
My closest friends all mirror some aspect of myself, and I some aspect of them. The more you mirror, the more likely you are to be friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my friends don&amp;rsquo;t have much in common, aside from being generally smart in various ways, and always having something or another that they can talk your ear off about.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

Being a game developer, I want to add it to my
own projects. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m broke and all existing solutions are expensive
to use (at least without a giant splash screen when you boot up the game.)
Obviously, being a programmer myself, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to write an audio
engine on my own. This is, of course, a completely giant task, and I am not
amazing at programming complex systems, especially at lower levels, so I
pretty much gave up. Before I gave up, though, I mentioned this project to a
friend of mine, &lt;a href="https://visu.do"&gt;River&lt;/a&gt;, who promptly didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it
and continued &lt;em&gt;rewriting the JVM&lt;/em&gt;. A few weeks back, though, they ended up
taking another look at the project, and we started working on it together.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

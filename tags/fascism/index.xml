In this time, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen
an alarming rise in antisemitism, an open genocide&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
And an &lt;em&gt;upsetting&lt;/em&gt; amount of people displaying how easy it is to sympathize with
fascism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been politically aware, Israel has been&amp;hellip; a complicated topic.
On the one hand, yes there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of antisemitism in the world even today, and
it&amp;rsquo;s good to have a country where people can go that&amp;rsquo;s made so that they don&amp;rsquo;t
have to worry about it. On the other hand, well&amp;hellip;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba"&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not like that land was free for use.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Eggs and Gender</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 09:10:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gender is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s such a social construct yet our society has been built on it on such a
fundamental level that to most it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; deal for most people to even
&lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; changing from the gender they&amp;rsquo;ve been assigned. It&amp;rsquo;s an even bigger
deal because of all the genocidal language that&amp;rsquo;s getting thrown around by
neofascists about trans people as of late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, of course, means it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to resume the questioning I&amp;rsquo;ve been
doing on and off for the last 5 years! Totally not dangerous at all! (I mean,
it&amp;rsquo;s really not all thar dangerous for me, thankfully. I&amp;rsquo;m living in a rather
left-leaning community in Canada, which is generally considered one of the best
countries to be queer in. Unfortunately, right next door to the south is one of
the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; countries to be trans in in the western world right now.
Republicans are using all sorts of rhetoric to try and villify them. The scary
part is that, for a lot of the conservatives in america, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt;. Fear
sells for a lot of people, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to pull people out of it a lot of the
time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

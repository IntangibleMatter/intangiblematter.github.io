You might notice something new down at the bottom of my blog posts. It&amp;rsquo;s a
comments section! You can leave comments on my ramblings if you have a Github
account and you sign in to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using a system called &lt;a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus&lt;/a> for my comments. It means I
don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about self-hosting anything, and I can just use github!
Specifically, Github discussions, which is a way for people to talk about a
repo on the site, and it means that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to handle anyone&amp;rsquo;s data
myself! If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Github account, I highly encourage you to make one!
It&amp;rsquo;s a great community of people who make all sorts of cool open-source stuff,
and it&amp;rsquo;s free and secure enough that I use it to run my comments! If nothing
else, the ability to tell me why the comments section is a bad idea is a good
reason to sign up for Github and comment on this blog!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

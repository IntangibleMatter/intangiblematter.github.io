&lt;p&gt;Reconciliation is an interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also an &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; complicated one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any of you in the audience who aren&amp;rsquo;t Canadian, Truth and Reconciliation is
an ongoing effort by the Government of Canada, and to varying degrees Canadian
citizens, to make amends for the horrors enacted upon the First Peoples of
Canada during colonization and the Residential School system. Its effectiveness
has been&amp;hellip; varied, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s doing the best work it can, considering
the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Training for the Future</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/05/23/training-for-the-future/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 10:37:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/05/23/training-for-the-future/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the 23rd of May, 2024, my high school psychology teacher claimed
that &amp;ldquo;the future started 2 days ago.&amp;rdquo; He was referring to GPT-4o and how
in another class of his several students came forward saying that, despite the
anti-AI measures that had been implemented in various courses, they still were
able to &amp;ldquo;cheat&amp;rdquo; with artificial intelligence and not be caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While his lecture had several points, the core was this: AI is the future, and
we need to rule it so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rule us. Being a neophobe will hurt you
incredibly, and will ultimately leave you behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mirrors</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 13:59:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like the people we get along best with are always, to some degree, mirrors of ourselves.
My closest friends all mirror some aspect of myself, and I some aspect of them. The more you mirror, the more likely you are to be friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my friends don&amp;rsquo;t have much in common, aside from being generally smart in various ways, and always having something or another that they can talk your ear off about.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

specifically &lt;em>World of Tomorrow Part Two: The Burden of Other People&amp;rsquo;s
Thoughts&lt;/em>. As per usual, I was crying by the ending of it, which is completely
expected if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with his work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/">my love for emotionally vulnerable media&lt;/a>,
and I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed how I feel about it. Genuinely as long as I can remember
I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with making and keeping friends, and have usually been (though
much more so since the start of my teenage years) somewhat lonely. I&amp;rsquo;ve found
comfort in the emotions I find in other people&amp;rsquo;s work, whether that be &lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s
Such a Beautiful Day&lt;/em> or &lt;em>The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rare Moments You Feel Like You're Real</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:10:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>You know how some people feel like they&amp;rsquo;re the only real person in the world?&lt;br>
I have the opposite problem.&lt;br>
To some degree.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a &amp;ldquo;teenager&amp;rdquo; is
&lt;em>supposed&lt;/em> to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations.
Whether it&amp;rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to
isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to
find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone
with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts. Even if this is a perfectly valid
way to exist, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> as such. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;em>supposed&lt;/em> to be out hanging out with friends, discovering myself, and just
taking time to &lt;em>be a teen&lt;/em>. But I don&amp;rsquo;t. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I ever really take
the time to just be a teen, because I&amp;rsquo;m too busy being &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;mature for my age&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> or
desperately clinging on to the memories of the times before my mental health
issues were overwhelming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm Fine: a Short Film</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>&lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m Fine&lt;/em> is a short film that I wrote, recorded, and filmed almost entirely
by myself in late April of 2023 for my high school&amp;rsquo;s film fest. I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas
for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the
first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t
be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects
of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while
resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically
justify why they exist by the mirror.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

specifically &lt;em&gt;World of Tomorrow Part Two: The Burden of Other People&amp;rsquo;s
Thoughts&lt;/em&gt;. As per usual, I was crying by the ending of it, which is completely
expected if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/"&gt;my love for emotionally vulnerable media&lt;/a&gt;,
and I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed how I feel about it. Genuinely as long as I can remember
I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with making and keeping friends, and have usually been (though
much more so since the start of my teenage years) somewhat lonely. I&amp;rsquo;ve found
comfort in the emotions I find in other people&amp;rsquo;s work, whether that be &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s
Such a Beautiful Day&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>YAUFYAITG</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/04/20/yaufyaitg/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 17:33:03 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/04/20/yaufyaitg/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the title stands for, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Yet Another Update From&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yet Another Internet Trans Girl&lt;/em&gt;, and this post is exactly what it says on the
tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/"&gt;posts about&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/"&gt;gender questioning&lt;/a&gt;
on this page, so it&amp;rsquo;s not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t read the
previous posts: I&amp;rsquo;m gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend
a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was
a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time
moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier,
etc, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fuck It, It's All Me</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 08:16:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/27/fuck-it-its-all-me/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve had my blog separated into two different pages:
&lt;code&gt;/posts/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/personal/&lt;/code&gt;. Posts was where my more general, public-friendly
stuff would go, and personal is my archive for all my personal ramblings. But
you know what, fuck it. It&amp;rsquo;s all me. Every post on here is me, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a
personal rambling or it&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how to do something in tech. It&amp;rsquo;s all me.
If you just want one, you can go ahead and use the two links at the top to
filter your experience. But this site is me, so everything on it is me. I&amp;rsquo;m not
going to pretend like I&amp;rsquo;m partitioned off into differrent people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don Hertzfeldt, Hangar, and the Desire to Be Human</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any amount of time talking to me (or, more accurately,
listening to me talk,) you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt.
Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described &lt;em&gt;Oscar-losing&lt;/em&gt; filmmaker. He makes animated
films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful
stories I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day&lt;/em&gt;, is an
hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their
limits. In it, you hear the story of Bill, a man suffering from an unspecified
mental disease, and through the film you experience some of his life from what
we can only assume to be his perspective as he goes through some difficult
events.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Rare Moments You Feel Like You're Real</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:10:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a song that I like. Might be good to listen to with this post. Idk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how some people feel like they&amp;rsquo;re the only real person in the world?&lt;br&gt;
I have the opposite problem.&lt;br&gt;
To some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a &amp;ldquo;teenager&amp;rdquo; is
&lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations.
Whether it&amp;rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to
isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to
find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone
with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts. Even if this is a perfectly valid
way to exist, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as such. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be out hanging out with friends, discovering myself, and just
taking time to &lt;em&gt;be a teen&lt;/em&gt;. But I don&amp;rsquo;t. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I ever really take
the time to just be a teen, because I&amp;rsquo;m too busy being &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;mature for my age&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; or
desperately clinging on to the memories of the times before my mental health
issues were overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My First Fullindie Meetup</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/06/my-first-fullindie-meetup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 23:27:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/06/my-first-fullindie-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on the ferry ride home from my very first FullIndie
meetup! I basically got on a bus &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; after school to get down to the ferry,
then I went into Vancouer and&amp;hellip; ate food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also all of this was with my friend &lt;a href="https://visu.do"&gt;River&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re cool.
Check them out. Without whom I probably would&amp;rsquo;ve been having an anxiety attack
for the whole trip so&amp;hellip; thanks, Riv!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we ate, we went down to the Skytrain and went down to the place where the
meetup was happening. We arrived half an hour early, and while we were waiting
for the doors to open two things happened:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Perfect Mac and Cheese (According to My Dead Dad)</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/27/the-perfect-mac-and-cheese-according-to-my-dead-dad/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 22:35:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/27/the-perfect-mac-and-cheese-according-to-my-dead-dad/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My dad (or as I and my family called him, Lala,) had a lot of experience with
making mac and cheese from a box. While he had cancer, he ate a lot of mac and
cheese because most foods didn&amp;rsquo;t taste good to him because of all the stuff in
his body to fight the cancer. One day, when he was too tired to make it
himself, he told me how he always makes it. He, quite honestly, made the best
box mac and cheese (and just straight up mac and cheese- I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fan of
the homemade stuff 99 times out of 100) I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted. Nostalgia bias?
Perhaps. But it&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good, as it had about 55 years of perfection
under its belt.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Eggs Like Russian Dolls</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 15:28:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/"&gt;a while back&lt;/a&gt;
I made a post about how my egg had cracked, and that I was, disappointingly,
cis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I now think that the egg had just cracked to reveal another egg.
I just kind of default to being cis because it&amp;rsquo;s what i know, and because I
feel uncomfortable with uncertainty, especially about core parts of myself.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think any &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; cis person could say the phrase &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m cis in the way
that I&amp;rsquo;d do lines of estrogen&amp;rdquo; with a straight face. Which is something that
I have done. Multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Oops!

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly a secret that I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to make friendships in
life. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at reading social signals, I&amp;rsquo;m always direct about
things that most people are at least &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; awkward about, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing
about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that
&lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice and not that they&amp;rsquo;re busy or something.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Heat Is Horrible</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 08:25:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s mid May and the temperature has suddenly shot up by about 10 degrees
where I live. If you lived in Ontario or something, this would probably be
normal, but I live in southwest BC. The temperature getting above or below 8-12
degrees is &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, especially this suddenly. Or I guess it isn&amp;rsquo;t weird, just
miserable. Another sucky part of it is that my town isn&amp;rsquo;t frequently this hot
so most buildings don&amp;rsquo;t have air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I'm Fine: a Short Film</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Fine&lt;/em&gt; is a short film that I wrote, recorded, and filmed almost entirely
by myself in late April of 2023 for my high school&amp;rsquo;s film fest. I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas
for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the
first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t
be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects
of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while
resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically
justify why they exist by the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>You've Cracked Your Egg, Now Fry in It</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:45:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/"&gt;made a post&lt;/a&gt; about
my gender and my experience in questioning. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that my egg
has recently cracked! And&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not trans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointing, right? I know, I was disappointed too. But it&amp;rsquo;s fine to not be
a member of a group with &lt;em&gt;so many cool members oh my god it&amp;rsquo;s statistically&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;anomalous how many cool trans people there are.&lt;/em&gt; What I am, however, is
someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t strongly identify with the societal construct of
masculinity. My dad didn&amp;rsquo;t either. ( Oh yeah, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, my dad, or as
I called him, Lala, died when I was 15 :/ ) He wore skirts a lot when I was
little and before I was born, he spent a lot of time wearing cool earings, and
he was a twice honorary lesbian, but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another time. A lot of
his friends were women, and if societal gender was strictly determined by the
way you emotionally interact with the world, he would probably have been deemed
a woman. I feel like that&amp;rsquo;s where I sit. I myself am male, and I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly
comfortable with that. I just feel a lot more comfortable socially, and a lot
more comradery with afab people than I do with guys most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>That One Person Who Presses All the Buttons</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:12:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have that one person who just somehow perfectly presses the buttons on
all of your insecurities without even knowing it? That person who just seems
so untouchable and perfect that their mere existence seems like some cosmic
joke at your expense? Even if you know they&amp;rsquo;re still human, and that they also
deal with issues like humans do, it just feels like they&amp;rsquo;ve figured out a
method for hiding all of their struggles perfectly?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Eggs and Gender</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 09:10:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gender is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s such a social construct yet our society has been built on it on such a
fundamental level that to most it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; deal for most people to even
&lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; changing from the gender they&amp;rsquo;ve been assigned. It&amp;rsquo;s an even bigger
deal because of all the genocidal language that&amp;rsquo;s getting thrown around by
neofascists about trans people as of late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, of course, means it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to resume the questioning I&amp;rsquo;ve been
doing on and off for the last 5 years! Totally not dangerous at all! (I mean,
it&amp;rsquo;s really not all thar dangerous for me, thankfully. I&amp;rsquo;m living in a rather
left-leaning community in Canada, which is generally considered one of the best
countries to be queer in. Unfortunately, right next door to the south is one of
the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; countries to be trans in in the western world right now.
Republicans are using all sorts of rhetoric to try and villify them. The scary
part is that, for a lot of the conservatives in america, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt;. Fear
sells for a lot of people, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to pull people out of it a lot of the
time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Brief Hantiplad About Everything Everywhere All At Once</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/22/a-brief-hantiplad-about-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:51:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/22/a-brief-hantiplad-about-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So I finally got to watch that movie everyone was talking about last year. It&amp;rsquo;s
honestly &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt; than everyone says. The effects were &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, the
writing was &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;, and the actors were all&amp;hellip; *&lt;em&gt;chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss&lt;/em&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Our deadpan-hyper chaotic-evil queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite character was &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; Jobu Tupekai. She&amp;rsquo;s honestly everything I
aspire to be. A cool, nihilistic, reality warping, amazing looking young adult
who created an object that can destroy the most powerful people somewhat out
of &lt;em&gt;boredom&lt;/em&gt;. She even &lt;em&gt;moves&lt;/em&gt; how I want to. Just a little bit crazy, and like
a cutesy cartoon character was given a few doses of evil maniac. People who
move in an animated way are the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;. And the head ticking to swap between
dimensions&amp;hellip; UGH! It&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant film, and I loved all the characters.
Waymond was adorable and we all need someone like him in our lives, Evelyn was
&lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a compelling character, and it was all.. ugh. &lt;em&gt;so amazing&lt;/em&gt;!!!1!1&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mirrors</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 13:59:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like the people we get along best with are always, to some degree, mirrors of ourselves.
My closest friends all mirror some aspect of myself, and I some aspect of them. The more you mirror, the more likely you are to be friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly a secret that I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to make friendships in
life. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at reading social signals, I&amp;rsquo;m always direct about
things that most people are at least &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; awkward about, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing
about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that
&lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice and not that they&amp;rsquo;re busy or something.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Heat Is Horrible</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 08:25:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/15/the-heat-is-horrible/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s mid May and the temperature has suddenly shot up by about 10 degrees
where I live. If you lived in Ontario or something, this would probably be
normal, but I live in southwest BC. The temperature getting above or below 8-12
degrees is &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, especially this suddenly. Or I guess it isn&amp;rsquo;t weird, just
miserable. Another sucky part of it is that my town isn&amp;rsquo;t frequently this hot
so most buildings don&amp;rsquo;t have air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>That One Person Who Presses All the Buttons</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:12:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have that one person who just somehow perfectly presses the buttons on
all of your insecurities without even knowing it? That person who just seems
so untouchable and perfect that their mere existence seems like some cosmic
joke at your expense? Even if you know they&amp;rsquo;re still human, and that they also
deal with issues like humans do, it just feels like they&amp;rsquo;ve figured out a
method for hiding all of their struggles perfectly?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

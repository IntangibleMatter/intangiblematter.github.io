&lt;em&gt;Yet Another Internet Trans Girl&lt;/em&gt;, and this post is exactly what it says on the
tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/"&gt;posts about&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/"&gt;my previous&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/"&gt;gender questioning&lt;/a&gt;
on this page, so it&amp;rsquo;s not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t read the
previous posts: I&amp;rsquo;m gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend
a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was
a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time
moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier,
etc, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Eggs Like Russian Dolls</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 15:28:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/"&gt;a while back&lt;/a&gt;
I made a post about how my egg had cracked, and that I was, disappointingly,
cis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I now think that the egg had just cracked to reveal another egg.
I just kind of default to being cis because it&amp;rsquo;s what i know, and because I
feel uncomfortable with uncertainty, especially about core parts of myself.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think any &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; cis person could say the phrase &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m cis in the way
that I&amp;rsquo;d do lines of estrogen&amp;rdquo; with a straight face. Which is something that
I have done. Multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>You've Cracked Your Egg, Now Fry in It</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:45:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/"&gt;made a post&lt;/a&gt; about
my gender and my experience in questioning. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that my egg
has recently cracked! And&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not trans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointing, right? I know, I was disappointed too. But it&amp;rsquo;s fine to not be
a member of a group with &lt;em&gt;so many cool members oh my god it&amp;rsquo;s statistically&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;anomalous how many cool trans people there are.&lt;/em&gt; What I am, however, is
someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t strongly identify with the societal construct of
masculinity. My dad didn&amp;rsquo;t either. ( Oh yeah, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, my dad, or as
I called him, Lala, died when I was 15 :/ ) He wore skirts a lot when I was
little and before I was born, he spent a lot of time wearing cool earings, and
he was a twice honorary lesbian, but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another time. A lot of
his friends were women, and if societal gender was strictly determined by the
way you emotionally interact with the world, he would probably have been deemed
a woman. I feel like that&amp;rsquo;s where I sit. I myself am male, and I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly
comfortable with that. I just feel a lot more comfortable socially, and a lot
more comradery with afab people than I do with guys most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Eggs and Gender</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 09:10:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gender is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s such a social construct yet our society has been built on it on such a
fundamental level that to most it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; deal for most people to even
&lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; changing from the gender they&amp;rsquo;ve been assigned. It&amp;rsquo;s an even bigger
deal because of all the genocidal language that&amp;rsquo;s getting thrown around by
neofascists about trans people as of late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, of course, means it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to resume the questioning I&amp;rsquo;ve been
doing on and off for the last 5 years! Totally not dangerous at all! (I mean,
it&amp;rsquo;s really not all thar dangerous for me, thankfully. I&amp;rsquo;m living in a rather
left-leaning community in Canada, which is generally considered one of the best
countries to be queer in. Unfortunately, right next door to the south is one of
the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; countries to be trans in in the western world right now.
Republicans are using all sorts of rhetoric to try and villify them. The scary
part is that, for a lot of the conservatives in america, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt;. Fear
sells for a lot of people, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to pull people out of it a lot of the
time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

making mac and cheese from a box. While he had cancer, he ate a lot of mac and
cheese because most foods didn&amp;rsquo;t taste good to him because of all the stuff in
his body to fight the cancer. One day, when he was too tired to make it
himself, he told me how he always makes it. He, quite honestly, made the best
box mac and cheese (and just straight up mac and cheese- I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fan of
the homemade stuff 99 times out of 100) I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted. Nostalgia bias?
Perhaps. But it&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good, as it had about 55 years of perfection
under its belt.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

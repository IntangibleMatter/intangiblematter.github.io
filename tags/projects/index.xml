Being a game developer, I want to add it to my
own projects. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m broke and all existing solutions are expensive
to use (at least without a giant splash screen when you boot up the game.)
Obviously, being a programmer myself, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to write an audio
engine on my own. This is, of course, a completely giant task, and I am not
amazing at programming complex systems, especially at lower levels, so I
pretty much gave up. Before I gave up, though, I mentioned this project to a
friend of mine, &lt;a href="https://visu.do">River&lt;/a>, who promptly didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it
and continued &lt;em>rewriting the JVM&lt;/em>. A few weeks back, though, they ended up
taking another look at the project, and we started working on it together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm Fine: a Short Film</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>&lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m Fine&lt;/em> is a short film that I wrote, recorded, and filmed almost entirely
by myself in late April of 2023 for my high school&amp;rsquo;s film fest. I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas
for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the
first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t
be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects
of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while
resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically
justify why they exist by the mirror.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

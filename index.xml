&lt;p>Reconciliation is an interesting topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also an &lt;em>incredibly&lt;/em> complicated one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For any of you in the audience who aren&amp;rsquo;t Canadian, Truth and Reconciliation is
an ongoing effort by the Government of Canada, and to varying degrees Canadian
citizens, to make amends for the horrors enacted upon the First Peoples of
Canada during colonization and the Residential School system. Its effectiveness
has been&amp;hellip; varied, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s doing the best work it can, considering
the circumstances.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Training for the Future</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/05/23/training-for-the-future/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 10:37:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/05/23/training-for-the-future/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Thursday, the 23rd of May, 2024, my high school psychology teacher claimed
that &amp;ldquo;the future started 2 days ago.&amp;rdquo; He was referring to GPT-4o and how
in another class of his several students came forward saying that, despite the
anti-AI measures that had been implemented in various courses, they still were
able to &amp;ldquo;cheat&amp;rdquo; with artificial intelligence and not be caught.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While his lecture had several points, the core was this: AI is the future, and
we need to rule it so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rule us. Being a neophobe will hurt you
incredibly, and will ultimately leave you behind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who Cares If I End Up on the No-Fly List</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/05/01/who-cares-if-i-end-up-on-the-no-fly-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 01:16:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/05/01/who-cares-if-i-end-up-on-the-no-fly-list/</guid><description>&lt;p>Jesus Christ. Jesus &lt;em>&lt;strong>FUCKING&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> Christ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that this alt-right bullshit has made it to mainstream Canadian
politics is fucking &lt;em>terrifying.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had an idea for a game kicking around in my head for a while now, something
commenting on the political situation in the world right now, &lt;em>specifically&lt;/em>
when it comes to transphobia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basic pitch is a stealth movement shooter where you assassinate prominent
anti-catgirl figures. Catgirls are definitely not acting as a stand in for
anything here, and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t look into it further.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>YAUFYAITG</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/04/20/yaufyaitg/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 17:33:03 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/04/20/yaufyaitg/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the title stands for, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Yet Another Update From&lt;/em>

on this page, so it&amp;rsquo;s not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t read the
previous posts: I&amp;rsquo;m gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend
a &lt;em>ton&lt;/em> of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was
a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time
moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier,
etc, etc, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fascism Litmus Test</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/03/19/fascism-litmus-test/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 10:31:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/03/19/fascism-litmus-test/</guid><description>&lt;p>As of writing, it has been 164 days since October 7th.

On the one hand, yes there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of antisemitism in the world even today, and

&lt;code>/posts/&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/personal/&lt;/code>. Posts was where my more general, public-friendly
stuff would go, and personal is my archive for all my personal ramblings. But
you know what, fuck it. It&amp;rsquo;s all me. Every post on here is me, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a
personal rambling or it&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how to do something in tech. It&amp;rsquo;s all me.
If you just want one, you can go ahead and use the two links at the top to
filter your experience. But this site is me, so everything on it is me. I&amp;rsquo;m not
going to pretend like I&amp;rsquo;m partitioned off into differrent people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Make a Screenspace Visualshader in Godot</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/25/how-to-make-a-screenspace-visualshader-in-godot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 11:10:12 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/01/25/how-to-make-a-screenspace-visualshader-in-godot/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="#the-actual-tutorial-bit-finally">&lt;em>Click here to skip to the instructions.&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Godot Engine has a really cool shader system, allowing you to do stuff like
change the way lighting works in both 2D &lt;em>and&lt;/em> 3D using nothing but shaders,
and it additionally has a &lt;em>powerful&lt;/em> VisualShader system. VisualShaders, for
those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, are shaders that use a Shader Graph system instead of pure
code. I&amp;rsquo;m not huge on node-based programming systems, so I usually elect to
(poorly) write a shader myself, but I&amp;rsquo;m working on a game jam with a larger team
than I ever have before right now, and they wanted to use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/arkology/ShaderV">ShaderV addon&lt;/a>
because of how many cool things it has.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing Fmod Studio on Pop!_OS</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/08/03/installing-fmod-studio-on-pop_os/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 01:27:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/08/03/installing-fmod-studio-on-pop_os/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, as a game developer, I &lt;em>love&lt;/em> FMOD. Advanced sound is always so cool to me!
However, when installing FMOD Studio on Pop!_OS, you&amp;rsquo;ll run into an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ dpkg -i fmodstudio&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.deb
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Package pulseaudio is not installed
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, even though it requires a &lt;em>bit&lt;/em> of editing files that you probably
shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite easy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, run &lt;code>dpkg -i --force-all fmodstudio&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.deb&lt;/code>. This installs FMOD
Studio, and FMOD Studio will run just fine! There&amp;rsquo;s an issue, though.
When you next try to install something with &lt;code>apt&lt;/code> you&amp;rsquo;ll discover that it
won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to install anything, because a dependency is unresolved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don Hertzfeldt, Hangar, and the Desire to Be Human</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/</guid><description>&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any amount of time talking to me (or, more accurately,
listening to me talk,) you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt.
Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described &lt;em>Oscar-losing&lt;/em> filmmaker. He makes animated
films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful
stories I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, &lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day&lt;/em>, is an
hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their
limits. In it, you hear the story of Bill, a man suffering from an unspecified
mental disease, and through the film you experience some of his life from what
we can only assume to be his perspective as he goes through some difficult
events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rare Moments You Feel Like You're Real</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:10:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/08/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p class="caption">Here&amp;#39;s a song that I like. Might be good to listen to with this post. Idk.&lt;/p>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know how some people feel like they&amp;rsquo;re the only real person in the world?&lt;br>
I have the opposite problem.&lt;br>
To some degree.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a &amp;ldquo;teenager&amp;rdquo; is
&lt;em>supposed&lt;/em> to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations.
Whether it&amp;rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to
isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to
find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone
with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts. Even if this is a perfectly valid
way to exist, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> as such. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;em>supposed&lt;/em> to be out hanging out with friends, discovering myself, and just
taking time to &lt;em>be a teen&lt;/em>. But I don&amp;rsquo;t. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I ever really take
the time to just be a teen, because I&amp;rsquo;m too busy being &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;mature for my age&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> or
desperately clinging on to the memories of the times before my mental health
issues were overwhelming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Fullindie Meetup</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/06/my-first-fullindie-meetup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 23:27:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/06/06/my-first-fullindie-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on the ferry ride home from my very first FullIndie

making mac and cheese from a box. While he had cancer, he ate a lot of mac and
cheese because most foods didn&amp;rsquo;t taste good to him because of all the stuff in
his body to fight the cancer. One day, when he was too tired to make it
himself, he told me how he always makes it. He, quite honestly, made the best
box mac and cheese (and just straight up mac and cheese- I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a fan of
the homemade stuff 99 times out of 100) I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted. Nostalgia bias?
Perhaps. But it&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good, as it had about 55 years of perfection
under its belt.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eggs Like Russian Dolls</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 15:28:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/</guid><description>&lt;p>So &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/">a while back&lt;/a>
I made a post about how my egg had cracked, and that I was, disappointingly,
cis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In retrospect, I now think that the egg had just cracked to reveal another egg.
I just kind of default to being cis because it&amp;rsquo;s what i know, and because I
feel uncomfortable with uncertainty, especially about core parts of myself.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think any &lt;em>truly&lt;/em> cis person could say the phrase &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m cis in the way
that I&amp;rsquo;d do lines of estrogen&amp;rdquo; with a straight face. Which is something that
I have done. Multiple times.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oops!

things that most people are at least &lt;em>somewhat&lt;/em> awkward about, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing

normal, but I live in southwest BC. The temperature getting above or below 8-12
degrees is &lt;em>weird&lt;/em>, especially this suddenly. Or I guess it isn&amp;rsquo;t weird, just

Being a game developer, I want to add it to my

to use (at least without a giant splash screen when you boot up the game.)
Obviously, being a programmer myself, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to write an audio
engine on my own. This is, of course, a completely giant task, and I am not
amazing at programming complex systems, especially at lower levels, so I
pretty much gave up. Before I gave up, though, I mentioned this project to a
friend of mine, &lt;a href="https://visu.do">River&lt;/a>, who promptly didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it

for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the
first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t
be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects
of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while
resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically
justify why they exist by the mirror.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You've Cracked Your Egg, Now Fry in It</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:45:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/28/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while back I &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/eggs-and-gender/">made a post&lt;/a> about
my gender and my experience in questioning. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that my egg
has recently cracked! And&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not trans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disappointing, right? I know, I was disappointed too. But it&amp;rsquo;s fine to not be
a member of a group with &lt;em>so many cool members oh my god it&amp;rsquo;s statistically&lt;/em>
&lt;em>anomalous how many cool trans people there are.&lt;/em> What I am, however, is
someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t strongly identify with the societal construct of
masculinity. My dad didn&amp;rsquo;t either. ( Oh yeah, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, my dad, or as
I called him, Lala, died when I was 15 :/ ) He wore skirts a lot when I was
little and before I was born, he spent a lot of time wearing cool earings, and
he was a twice honorary lesbian, but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another time. A lot of
his friends were women, and if societal gender was strictly determined by the
way you emotionally interact with the world, he would probably have been deemed
a woman. I feel like that&amp;rsquo;s where I sit. I myself am male, and I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly
comfortable with that. I just feel a lot more comfortable socially, and a lot
more comradery with afab people than I do with guys most of the time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>That One Person Who Presses All the Buttons</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:12:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you have that one person who just somehow perfectly presses the buttons on

You might notice something new down at the bottom of my blog posts. It&amp;rsquo;s a
comments section! You can leave comments on my ramblings if you have a Github
account and you sign in to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using a system called &lt;a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus&lt;/a> for my comments. It means I
don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about self-hosting anything, and I can just use github!
Specifically, Github discussions, which is a way for people to talk about a
repo on the site, and it means that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to handle anyone&amp;rsquo;s data
myself! If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Github account, I highly encourage you to make one!
It&amp;rsquo;s a great community of people who make all sorts of cool open-source stuff,

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s such a social construct yet our society has been built on it on such a
fundamental level that to most it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> deal for most people to even
&lt;em>consider&lt;/em> changing from the gender they&amp;rsquo;ve been assigned. It&amp;rsquo;s an even bigger
deal because of all the genocidal language that&amp;rsquo;s getting thrown around by
neofascists about trans people as of late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which, of course, means it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to resume the questioning I&amp;rsquo;ve been
doing on and off for the last 5 years! Totally not dangerous at all! (I mean,
it&amp;rsquo;s really not all thar dangerous for me, thankfully. I&amp;rsquo;m living in a rather
left-leaning community in Canada, which is generally considered one of the best
countries to be queer in. Unfortunately, right next door to the south is one of
the &lt;em>worst&lt;/em> countries to be trans in in the western world right now.
Republicans are using all sorts of rhetoric to try and villify them. The scary
part is that, for a lot of the conservatives in america, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>working&lt;/em>. Fear
sells for a lot of people, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to pull people out of it a lot of the
time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Brief Hantiplad About Everything Everywhere All At Once</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/22/a-brief-hantiplad-about-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:51:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/03/22/a-brief-hantiplad-about-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I finally got to watch that movie everyone was talking about last year. It&amp;rsquo;s
honestly &lt;em>even better&lt;/em> than everyone says. The effects were &lt;em>amazing&lt;/em>, the
writing was &lt;em>fantastic&lt;/em>, and the actors were all&amp;hellip; *&lt;em>chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss&lt;/em>*.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://intangiblematter.github.io/media/a-brief-hantiplad-about-everything-everywhere/jobu_tupekai_is_iconic.GIF" title="god I wish I knew how to look this good in makeup" alt="Jobu Tupaki it&amp;#39;s organic gif">

&lt;p class="caption">Our deadpan-hyper chaotic-evil queen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favourite character was &lt;em>easily&lt;/em> Jobu Tupekai. She&amp;rsquo;s honestly everything I
aspire to be. A cool, nihilistic, reality warping, amazing looking young adult
who created an object that can destroy the most powerful people somewhat out
of &lt;em>boredom&lt;/em>. She even &lt;em>moves&lt;/em> how I want to. Just a little bit crazy, and like
a cutesy cartoon character was given a few doses of evil maniac. People who
move in an animated way are the &lt;em>best&lt;/em>. And the head ticking to swap between
dimensions&amp;hellip; UGH! It&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant film, and I loved all the characters.
Waymond was adorable and we all need someone like him in our lives, Evelyn was
&lt;em>such&lt;/em> a compelling character, and it was all.. ugh. &lt;em>so amazing&lt;/em>!!!1!1&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mirrors</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 13:59:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</guid><description>&lt;p>I feel like the people we get along best with are always, to some degree, mirrors of ourselves.
My closest friends all mirror some aspect of myself, and I some aspect of them. The more you mirror, the more likely you are to be friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of my friends don&amp;rsquo;t have much in common, aside from being generally smart in various ways, and always having something or another that they can talk your ear off about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Game Engines [ARCHIVE]</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2021/07/12/game-engines-archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 10:01:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2021/07/12/game-engines-archive/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>PLEASE NOTE: this is an archive from my original blog. It was my only post.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#111;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Before we begin: A game engine is a tool which is used to create games. It
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>usually has a user interface and a scripting language (a specialized programming
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>language unique to the engine) of some sort.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>A game _framework_ is a library of code which can be added to your code so it&amp;#39;s
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>easier to make a game. These generally require substantially more knowledge and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>coding skill.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, as many of you know, &lt;a href="https://intangiblematter.itch.io">I like to make games.&lt;/a>
A lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve published four games (as
of writing) and have created several more. However, my choice of game engine
hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been consistent. The first engine I tried to use was, as is many
people&amp;rsquo;s first choice, Unity. My time with this engine was short, and I had a
great deal of trouble trying to grock how it works.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

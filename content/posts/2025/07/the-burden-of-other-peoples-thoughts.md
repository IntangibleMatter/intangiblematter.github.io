As I do every so often, I recently rewatched one of Don Hertzfeldt's films,
specifically *World of Tomorrow Part Two: The Burden of Other People's
Thoughts*. As per usual, I was crying by the ending of it, which is completely
expected if you're familiar with his work.

I've written before about [my love for emotionally vulnerable media]({{<ref "/posts/2023/07/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human.md" >}}),
and I haven't changed how I feel about it. Genuinely as long as I can remember
I've struggled with making and keeping friends, and have usually been (though
much more so since the start of my teenage years) somewhat lonely. I've found
comfort in the emotions I find in other people's work, whether that be *It's
Such a Beautiful Day* or *The Beginner's Guide*.

Not to mention, of course, my proclivity for [parasocial relationships]({{<ref "/posts/2023/05/oops-all-parasocial.md" >}}).

Anyways, in rewatching the movie, I started thinking about how I love media
which tells you to live in the moment, and to explore the world and gain new
experiences

and how I... never do any of that.

It's not because of expectations from other people, or what I think people need
from me, it's something about who I fundamentally am as a person that makes it
so that I just... can't do that. The only person stopping me is myself; I don't
feel the burden of other people's thoughts, or at least not to any meaningful
degree. The problem is that I have expectations for myself and "who I am", and
I cannot let myself fail at those. I fought *hard* to get a sense of who I am in
this world which I could stick with; the thought of abandoning it, even for
something that would make me so much happier, is *terrifying*.

(This is also probably why I haven't done more to transition yet, still just
waiting for the endo appointment.)

I've trapped myself in a cage of who I'm supposed to be, who I am is another
matter. Even though I'm generally quite authentically "myself" to other people,
I still have things I hold myself to so that I appear a certain way. Can't look
like you aren't confident in who you are when around other people.

Anyways, this is a ramble I wrote at 4 in the morning one day while crying, and
I don't know where to go with it from here, so, uh... thanks for reading?

I'll leave you with this quote from the first *[World of
Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PUIxEWmsvI)*:

> Do not lose time on daily trivialities. \
> Do not dwell on petty detail.\
> For all of these things melt away and drift \
> apart within the obscure traffic of time.\
> Live well and live broadly. \
> You are alive and living now.\
> Now is the envy of \
> all of the dead.

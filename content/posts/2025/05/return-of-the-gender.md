If you want to see my older posts about gender,

A lot of people talk about not realizing they're trans until later in life, or
repressing it because they don't feel ready to come out or whatever. That wasn't
my problem.

Throughout most of my teenage years I was trying to figure out my gender,
because there was *something* which made me feel like I was probably trans, but
no matter what I just couldn't get to the heart of whatever it was that was
going on. I'd frequently make reference to probably being trans, I'd write posts
about it (as you can see on this blog), but I never could get to the core of it.
In all honesty this was probably because I was dealing with a lot of other shit
in my life that made it hard to actually have time for introspection, because
when I moved out for university suddenly I had to deal with that all again in
*full* force.

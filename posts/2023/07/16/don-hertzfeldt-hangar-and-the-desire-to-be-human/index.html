			So if you&rsquo;ve spent any amount of time talking to me (or, more accurately,
listening to me talk,) you&rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt.
Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described Oscar-losing filmmaker. He makes animated
films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful
stories I&rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, It&rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day, is an
hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their
limits. In it, you hear the story of Bill, a man suffering from an unspecified
mental disease, and through the film you experience some of his life from what
we can only assume to be his perspective as he goes through some difficult
events.

It's Such a Beautiful Day, World of Tomorrow</span></div><br><br><article id=main><p>So if you&rsquo;ve spent any amount of time talking to me (or, more accurately,
listening to me talk,) you&rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt.
Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described <em>Oscar-losing</em> filmmaker. He makes animated
films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful
stories I&rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, <em>It&rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day</em>, is an
hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their
limits. In it, you hear the story of Bill, a man suffering from an unspecified
mental disease, and through the film you experience some of his life from what
we can only assume to be his perspective as he goes through some difficult
events.</p><p>What always strikes me about this film, is that on top of all of its oddities
(I must say I am doing a horrible job selling it), it is one of the most
remarkably <em>human</em> flims, or just straight up <em>works</em> I&rsquo;ve ever seen. You
experience so many mundane details and things that happen in this person&rsquo;s
life. All of these completely banal experiences in life, all these things that
nobody ever thinks of as interesting enough to talk about, included in this
masterpiece of a film that I have watched <em>over a dozen times</em> and still makes
me cry.</p><iframe class=rounded width=100% height=150 src="https://odesli.co/embed/?url=https%3a%2f%2fmusic.apple.com%2fca%2falbum%2fhangar%2f1561457977%3fi%3d1561457978&theme=dark" frameborder=0 allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"></iframe><p><em>Hangar</em> is a song by 8485, and I have listened to it over 480 times <em>this year</em>
<em>alone</em>. It features some of the most lovely vocals I&rsquo;ve ever heard in a modern
song overtop of drawn out synthwave beats. That already is enough to make
me <em>like</em> the song, but what makes it probably my favourite song are the
<em>lyrics</em>. Exploring themes of feeling stuck, wanting to escape, and
simultaneously living in the moment and thinking of the future and the past.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a little part where I&rsquo;m going to put some of my favourite lyrics from
the song. You don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to read it, but you can.</p><blockquote><p>[<strong>first verse</strong>]<br>Come pick me up, I&rsquo;ll pay for gas<br>There&rsquo;s nowhere that I want to be<br>And you&rsquo;ll drive fast and I won&rsquo;t ask<br>To pick the music or the street<br>And we can talk about whatever<br>And pretend that we won&rsquo;t tell<br>Even pretending to ourselves\</p><p>[<strong>final chorus</strong>]<br>But I can&rsquo;t bring myself to<br>Hate me for wanting a break<br>I&rsquo;ll still be here in five years<br>Where I made every mistake<br>Sixteen trying to disappear<br>For one week and a half<br>You know it&rsquo;s all an act<br>There&rsquo;s still a lot I haven&rsquo;t put into words yet</p><p>[(<strong>this is also the first chorus</strong>)]<br>This place is suffocating<br>I&rsquo;ll still be here in five years<br>Like I promise I won&rsquo;t<br>Through the wind in your ears<br>But nothing feels as urgent<br>And these nights are still important<br>And there&rsquo;s still a lot I haven&rsquo;t put into words yet</p></blockquote><p><em>( this is as little as I could stand to put so I decided to cut it there</em>
<em>because I could <strong>easily</strong> just put the whole song&rsquo;s lyrics in&mldr; )</em></p><p>This song is just so beautifully <em>human</em>. Even if I can&rsquo;t properly relate to
all of it, due to me basically just&mldr; staying at home on my computer all the
time, instead of going for drives with friends and making stupid teenage
decisions. But that&rsquo;s the beauty of it, I don&rsquo;t have to have all that much in
common with eighty, because the song is so completely <em>human</em>. It&rsquo;s so uniquely
someone&rsquo;s experience, and that&rsquo;s what I love. I love seeing things through
other people&rsquo;s eyes, and feeling like I&rsquo;m being let in on deeply personal
things. It&rsquo;s why I gravitate towards all this media which feels so human.</p><p>I love it because when I don&rsquo;t have anyone who cares to share experiences with
me, or anyone to tell me about how they&rsquo;re <em>really</em> doing, or anything like
that, <em>I still have these pieces of media</em>. Media doesn&rsquo;t leave you. Media
doesn&rsquo;t judge you for being honest. <em>Media doesn&rsquo;t lie to your face and claim</em>
<em>that they&rsquo;re having a great day and you aren&rsquo;t annoying them at all.</em></p><p>These pieces of media, and so many more let me feel human when other people
don&rsquo;t.</p><p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s my 3am rambling for today</p><p>Thanks For listening</p><ul><li>L++;</li></ul></article><div class=prev-next-post-links><span class=next-post><a class=link-reverse href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/08/03/installing-fmod-studio-on-pop_os/?ref=footer">&lt;- Installing Fmod Studio on Pop!_OS</a>

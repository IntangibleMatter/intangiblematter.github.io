			A while back I made a post about
my gender and my experience in questioning. I&rsquo;m happy to announce that my egg
has recently cracked! And&mldr; I&rsquo;m not trans.
Disappointing, right? I know, I was disappointed too. But it&rsquo;s fine to not be
a member of a group with so many cool members oh my god it&rsquo;s statistically
anomalous how many cool trans people there are. What I am, however, is
someone who doesn&rsquo;t strongly identify with the societal construct of
masculinity. My dad didn&rsquo;t either. ( Oh yeah, if you didn&rsquo;t know, my dad, or as
I called him, Lala, died when I was 15 :/ ) He wore skirts a lot when I was
little and before I was born, he spent a lot of time wearing cool earings, and
he was a twice honorary lesbian, but that&rsquo;s a story for another time. A lot of
his friends were women, and if societal gender was strictly determined by the
way you emotionally interact with the world, he would probably have been deemed
a woman. I feel like that&rsquo;s where I sit. I myself am male, and I&rsquo;m perfectly
comfortable with that. I just feel a lot more comfortable socially, and a lot
more comradery with afab people than I do with guys most of the time.

with them more than I do guys. Not to say I dislike guys, just that I usually
don&rsquo;t find as much in common with them or get along with them as well.</p><p>Also for the one person who stumbles across this blog and is like &ldquo;oh no!
guys and gals being friends? There&rsquo;s obviously going to be dating!&rdquo;
First of all, I&rsquo;m the only (cis) guy in my friend group at present, and I&rsquo;m
also the only person who isn&rsquo;t aroace. Guys can still think
<a href=https://youtu.be/Y2Y5KVtU810>girls are all really cute and great</a> without
wanting to be sexual with all of them.</p><p><a href=https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/><strong>UPDATE: 2023-05-23</strong></a></p></div><div class=prev-next-post-links><span class=next-post><a class=link-reverse href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/?ref=footer">&lt;- I'm Fine: a Short Film</a>

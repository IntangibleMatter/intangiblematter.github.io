life. I&rsquo;ve never been good at reading social signals, I&rsquo;m always direct about
things that most people are at least <em>somewhat</em> awkward about, and I&rsquo;ve always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing
about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that
<em>obviously</em> someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep
that I didn&rsquo;t notice and not that they&rsquo;re busy or something.</p><p>Combine all of these together and you get a kid who struggles to make
real life connections, but <em>thrives</em> on the internet. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve
never made any internet friends (so far,) so instead I&rsquo;ve become someone who
has a lot of the oft-maligned <em>parasocial relationships</em>.</p><p>A parasocial relationship, for those of you who don&rsquo;t know, is a
one-directional relationship between someone who creates content and someone
who consumes that content. An example of this might be people who trust Tucker
Carlson on everything because he talks in a way that speaks to them and feels
personal, so people begin to trust him, form relationships with him, and value
what he values. All of this is, of course, one-sided. He has no idea anyone in
his audience exists in particular, and he&rsquo;s just there to make some money and
spread some hate.</p><p>Parasocial relationships, despite all of their downfalls, have gotten me
through a lot of my adolescent years. Even if I fully <em>know</em> that this is just
a person observing a content creator, I still feel more close to some youtubers
who I follow than some of my own peers. I mean, these people make things that I
find very funny, very relatable, and very enjoyable. If I just knew them in
<em>person</em> instead of observing them from a distance over the internet, we would
be good friends, right? I&rsquo;m anxious, they&rsquo;re anxious, I&rsquo;m into weird indie
games, they&rsquo;re into weird indie games, I&rsquo;m 17, they&rsquo;re&mldr; 26.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t be the only person who finds themselves desperately wanting to be
famous on the internet just to join those social circles that look so <em>fun</em>,
can I? The chaos of Alpharad, the nerdy theatrics of Brian David Gilbert, the
unbridled honesty of Jaiden, Illymations, and Let Me Explain Studios&mldr;</p><p>I know I&rsquo;ll never meet these people, and I know it&rsquo;s stupid and probably
creepy, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be here today if I didn&rsquo;t have these pieces of
content to bond to. People are hard and misunderstand you. A youtube video
won&rsquo;t describe your weekend plans and then call you a loser for not going out
to the beach with friends without even knowing that what they just described
as pathetic is the only thing you can do without having a panic attack over
potentially inconveniencing someone.</p><p>I have real life friends. I wrote most of this post while a friend was hanging
out at my house. But I&rsquo;ve never had many, and there&rsquo;s always some distance. I
will always, to some degree, crave the anonymity, chaos, and joy of having
a cool group of people on the internet to spend time with. It may fade away
someday, but I don&rsquo;t see that happening anytime soon.</p><p>Anyways yeah if you&rsquo;re an awkward &ldquo;loser&rdquo; who feels like the internet makes
more sense than people do and you would be doing <em>so</em> well if you could just
get into those circles, then know you aren&rsquo;t alone. No matter how much it feels
like it.</p><div class=prev-next-post-links><span class=next-post><a class=link-reverse href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/?ref=footer">&lt;- Eggs Like Russian Dolls</a>

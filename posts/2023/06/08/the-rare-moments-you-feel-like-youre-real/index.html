You know how some people feel like they&rsquo;re the only real person in the world?
I have the opposite problem.
To some degree.
Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a &ldquo;teenager&rdquo; is supposed to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations. Whether it&rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts."><meta property="og:title" content="IntangibleMatter - The Rare Moments You Feel Like You're Real"><meta property="og:image" content="/img/logo/intangible.png"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi!

<em>supposed</em> to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations.
Whether it&rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to
isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to
find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone
with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts. Even if this is a perfectly valid
way to exist, it still doesn&rsquo;t quite <em>feel</em> as such. It feels like I&rsquo;m
<em>supposed</em> to be out hanging out with friends, discovering myself, and just
taking time to <em>be a teen</em>. But I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t feel like I ever really take
the time to just be a teen, because I&rsquo;m too busy being <em>&ldquo;mature for my age&rdquo;</em> or
desperately clinging on to the memories of the times before my mental health
issues were overwhelming.</p><p>I almost always feel like I&rsquo;m an impostor of a teenager, an impostor of a
person. A desperate attempt to seem anything like what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; is <em>&ldquo;supposed&rdquo;</em>
to be. Not even <em>normal</em>, just not <em>totally disconnected</em> from this reality&rsquo;s
understanding of how things are <em>supposed</em> to be.</p><p>I have friends. Good ones. The ones I spend the most <em>(read: any)</em> time with
are also socially isolated loners like me, so I really only see them at
school for the most part. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, but then social
media comes into play and I see all of the posts of classmates who
<a href=https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/04/26/that-one-person-who-presses-all-the-buttons/><em>I don&rsquo;t even really like all that much</em></a>
spending time together and smiling and just&mldr; <em>being teens</em>. Having bonding
moments they&rsquo;ll remember forever with their friends at the beach at sunset,
sharing who they are, or even just messing around in ways that I not only
rarely <em>(if ever)</em> experience, but can barely understand.</p><p>So the moments where I feel like I actually exist in the role I have are few
and far between, but they mean a lot to me. They&rsquo;re almost always totally
innocuous things that most people wouldn&rsquo;t think about for more than a second,
but for me they remind me that I exist.</p><p>The reason I&rsquo;m thinking of this now (aside from blasting 8485&rsquo;s <em>Hangar</em> at one
in the morning) is because yesterday, after the FullIndie event, I was waiting
on the skytrain platform with a friend and two of their friends who I hadn&rsquo;t
met before. While we were waiting for this train, I took a minute to tell one
of the two friends a whole bunch of assumptions I had about them (most of which
turned out to be approximately right, I&rsquo;m pretty good at reading people), and
observed their reaction to being perceived by another person while my friend
and their other friend commented on what was going on. I don&rsquo;t know why, but
something about that moment just felt like a moment that you&rsquo;re <em>supposed</em> to
be having as a teenager, and the kind of moment I so rarely have.</p><p>So now I&rsquo;m sitting here crying over how I felt while sitting in the cold in
Richmond waiting to go home, and how desperately I want to have moments like
that more often, and how I probably won&rsquo;t.</p><p>Maybe they aren&rsquo;t really special moments, maybe they&rsquo;re just moments where the
constant vague dissociation that I barely notice anymore has taken a little
step back, and that&rsquo;s how it feels for me. I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Anyways, yeah. If you feel like this too, you aren&rsquo;t alone.</p><div class=prev-next-post-links><span class=next-post><a class=link-reverse href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/07/16/don-hertzfeldt-hangar-and-the-desire-to-be-human/?ref=footer">&lt;- Installing Fmod Studio on Pop!_OS</a>

			As I do every so often, I recently rewatched one of Don Hertzfeldt&rsquo;s films,

Thoughts. As per usual, I was crying by the ending of it, which is completely
expected if you&rsquo;re familiar with his work.

and I haven&rsquo;t changed how I feel about it. Genuinely as long as I can remember
I&rsquo;ve struggled with making and keeping friends, and have usually been (though
much more so since the start of my teenage years) somewhat lonely. I&rsquo;ve found
comfort in the emotions I find in other people&rsquo;s work, whether that be It&rsquo;s
Such a Beautiful Day or The Beginner&rsquo;s Guide.

and I haven&rsquo;t changed how I feel about it. Genuinely as long as I can remember
I&rsquo;ve struggled with making and keeping friends, and have usually been (though
much more so since the start of my teenage years) somewhat lonely. I&rsquo;ve found
comfort in the emotions I find in other people&rsquo;s work, whether that be <em>It&rsquo;s
Such a Beautiful Day</em> or <em>The Beginner&rsquo;s Guide</em>.</p><p>Not to mention, of course, my proclivity for <a href=https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/oops-all-parasocial/>parasocial relationships</a>.</p><p>Anyways, in rewatching the movie, I started thinking about how I love media
which tells you to live in the moment, and to explore the world and gain new
experiences</p><p>and how I&mldr; never do any of that.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not because of expectations from other people, or what I think people need
from me, it&rsquo;s something about who I fundamentally am as a person that makes it
so that I just&mldr; can&rsquo;t do that. The only person stopping me is myself; I don&rsquo;t
feel the burden of other people&rsquo;s thoughts, or at least not to any meaningful
degree. The problem is that I have expectations for myself and &ldquo;who I am&rdquo;, and
I cannot let myself fail at those. I fought <em>hard</em> to get a sense of who I am in
this world which I could stick with; the thought of abandoning it, even for
something that would make me so much happier, is <em>terrifying</em>.</p><p>(This is also probably why I haven&rsquo;t done more to transition yet, still just
waiting for the endo appointment.)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve trapped myself in a cage of who I&rsquo;m supposed to be, who I am is another
matter. Even though I&rsquo;m generally quite authentically &ldquo;myself&rdquo; to other people,
I still have things I hold myself to so that I appear a certain way. Can&rsquo;t look
like you aren&rsquo;t confident in who you are when around other people.</p><p>Anyways, this is a ramble I wrote at 4 in the morning one day while crying, and
I don&rsquo;t know where to go with it from here, so, uh&mldr; thanks for reading?</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with this quote from the first <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PUIxEWmsvI">World of
Tomorrow</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>Do not lose time on daily trivialities.<br>Do not dwell on petty detail.<br>For all of these things melt away and drift<br>apart within the obscure traffic of time.<br>Live well and live broadly.<br>You are alive and living now.<br>Now is the envy of<br>all of the dead.</p></blockquote></article><div class=prev-next-post-links><span class=next-post></span><span class=previous-post><a class=link-reverse href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/06/17/reconciliation/?ref=footer">Reconciliation -></a></span></div><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=IntangibleMatter/intangiblematter.github.io data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQzNzc2Mzc=" data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOFR9fpc4CV2n9 data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=top data-theme=https://intangiblematter.net/css/giscus.min.css data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=social-links><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4WADLmaQKdI_mC4-Dd3R4g title=Youtube class=social-link><img src=/img/icons/youtube.svg>

Reconciliation is an interesting topic.
It&rsquo;s also an incredibly complicated one.
For any of you in the audience who aren&rsquo;t Canadian, Truth and Reconciliation is
an ongoing effort by the Government of Canada, and to varying degrees Canadian
citizens, to make amends for the horrors enacted upon the First Peoples of
Canada during colonization and the Residential School system. Its effectiveness
has been&mldr; varied, but overall it&rsquo;s doing the best work it can, considering
the circumstances.

an ongoing effort by the Government of Canada, and to varying degrees Canadian
citizens, to make amends for the horrors enacted upon the First Peoples of
Canada during colonization and the Residential School system. Its effectiveness
has been&mldr; varied, but overall it&rsquo;s doing the best work it can, considering
the circumstances.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all from my white-ass perspective, though, so take it with a heaping
pinch of salt.</p><p>I will say, though, that given my perspective is from my incredibly white ass,
I&rsquo;d like to think it&rsquo;s better informed than a lot of other white-ass opinions
for a few reasons.</p><ol><li>I spend a <em>lot</em> of time looking into the thoughts of minority groups so I
can better understand their thoughts and needs, and act better as an ally.</li><li>My family&rsquo;s always had a rather close relationship with many indigenous
people, and I&rsquo;ve grown up hearing their thoughts.</li><li>Various subcomponents of the previous item.</li></ol><p>I think that, from my experience at least, BC seems to have a rather unique
relationship with its indigenous population. We&rsquo;re the <em>only</em> province to
be composed primarily of unceded land, rather than territory that was stolen
<em>legally</em> through documents. This goes back to early Canadian history. While
the rest of the English territories overtook the land the indigenous peoples
lived on, the early settlers in British Columbia took an approach more akin
to the first French fort on the land, settling in places not already occupied
and doing trade with the indigenous population.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> At least, until eastern
Canada decided they didn&rsquo;t like this approach and forced the people living in BC
to start acting more like &ldquo;<em>proper</em>&rdquo; settlers. British Columbia would later have
the third highest count of Residential Schools in the country, with the only
higher counts being found in the prairies. BC is also home to the first nation
to regain self-governance, the Sh√≠sh√°lh nation. And even in the modern day,
though this could just be a byproduct of my slightly countercultural upbringing,
indigenous stories are well-known by many in BC. Hell, I could tell you the
story of how the Raven stole the Sun before I could tell you that I was
Canadian. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ve been relegated to land acknowledgements like it
feels like they have been in some other places in Canada. This could all, of
course, be me buying into colonial narratives, but considering my sources for
the &lsquo;positives&rsquo; are all from indigenous writings I&rsquo;ve read over the years I&rsquo;d
like to think that they&rsquo;re at least <em>fairly</em> accurate.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way: in Canada the natives got <em>fucked</em>. From
the spread of terrible disease in the early days wiping out large portions of
the population to terrible land agreements to the <em>entire residential school
system</em> (something I <em>do not</em> have time to get into, but if you don&rsquo;t know what
it is, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system>Wikipedia is always a good place to start</a>.)
But tl;dr: about 100 years of &ldquo;schools&rdquo; that were centres for physical and
sexual abuse and had the goal of &ldquo;taking the Indian out of the child&rdquo;. These
schools are now recognized as a form of cultural genocide.</p><p>So obviously we as a country need to make some form of amends, right? After all,
we stole their land, attempted (and largely succeeded in) erasing their
languages, suppressing their culture, and a billion other things. Though in our
defence we <em>did</em> introduce them to poutine so&mldr; it&rsquo;s not <em>only</em> bad things?</p><p>The formal process of this in Canada started in 2008 with the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (or TRC,) an organization with the purpose of
recognizing the impacts of the Residential School system on those who survived
it and their families, the history of the schools, and documenting it all.
Its other task was to try to start the process of reconciling with the
indigenous populations of Canada, and to try to make amends for what settlers
have done to them since the start of colonialism in Canada.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not here to give you a history, though. I&rsquo;m here to tell you about what
reconciliation means to me, and that&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;m not entirely sure the
answer to.</p><p>Reconciliation is without a doubt an <em>incredibly</em> important process for this
country, a country known on the world stage for being kind and courteous, to
make its reality more closely resemble how people think of it. But it&rsquo;s also
disingenuous of Canada to act like it only needs to atone for issues in the
past. After all, how many communities <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t have clean drinking water to
this day? We haven&rsquo;t stopped acting as oppressors, we&rsquo;ve just stopped the
<em>blatant</em> genocide. We&rsquo;ve moved on to more subtle forms, like
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon_freezing_deaths>&ldquo;starlight tours&rdquo;</a><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>
or <a href=https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/home-page/>all but ignoring the epidemic of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls</a>.
We&rsquo;re not at the point where we can genuinely reconcile. We&rsquo;re as complicit as
ever in the oppression and death of our indigenous population, but because these
aren&rsquo;t <em>enforced by law</em> like residential schools are, we can still give
ourselves a pat on the back about &ldquo;doing better&rdquo;. While reconciliation isn&rsquo;t
something we should delay, it is at present arguably <em>more</em> for the comfort and
peace of mind of white people than it is for actually making up for past
wrongdoings and improving the living situation of the indigenous people in
Canada. After all, an apology is only an apology if you actually stop the
behaviour for which you&rsquo;re apologizing, right? And so far we <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> stopped.</p><p>My mom used to be a documentarian out on the oil pipeline protests, back in the
early 2000s. She&rsquo;s been an activist for about as long as she&rsquo;s been alive. She
had a lot of conversations with the indigenous people who were also protesting
there, and learned a lot about their perspectives. There&rsquo;s one specific example
that I wish to discuss here, however. She was talking to someone who was
expressing the belief that all the settlers should go back to where they came
from, and leave this place to the people it belonged to for millenia before. She
then asked about what she should do, considering she&rsquo;s a Jewish woman<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>, and the
history of antisemitism in Europe. This got her conversation partner to stop
for a moment, and think about the &ldquo;go home everyone&rdquo; position with a bit more
nuance than before. After all, Canada isn&rsquo;t just a country of British settlers,
it&rsquo;s also one of the most diverse countries in the world, holding both the <em>most
racially diverse city on Earth</em> and the single most Asian city outside of Asia.
This is a country which, while not built on positions of equality and equity,
now continually strives to be a global leader in diversity. Most Canadians feel
less attachment to &ldquo;where they came from&rdquo; than where they live today. I know
that that&rsquo;s true for me.</p><p>This sentiment of telling everyone else to go home isn&rsquo;t an uncommon one, and I
understand why. You want your oppressors to go away and leave you to be who you
would be without them, but it&rsquo;s nowhere <em>near</em> that simple of a problem to
solve. I&rsquo;m not going to pretend I have the answers, though. I&rsquo;m just generally
against one-size-fits-all solutions to problems regarding nationality and
population, they usually tend to have some nationalist undertones, and I&rsquo;m
firmly against nationalism in any forms.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what needs to happen next, and I&rsquo;m not going to pretend to.
Reconciliation is an ongoing process, and we need to keep doing better with it
than we currently are. I always put forth an effort to listen to the current
issues that indigenous peoples here face, and I&rsquo;m an anti-racist, but I can&rsquo;t
claim that I&rsquo;m a perfect example of a Canadian in the modern day in regards to
this issue. I just think that we need to be doing a <em>lot</em> more than we are right
now.</p><p>And if I got any (or all!) of this wrong, <em>please</em> feel free to contact me (my
email is at the bottom of every page,) and tell me how I can do better in the
future. My goal is to always be the most correct I can be, and as such I take no
issue with being corrected with genuine information.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>At least, this is what I remember from various readings I&rsquo;ve done. I know
it wasn&rsquo;t always like this, and that there were still issues, but from what
I&rsquo;ve read (or at least <em>remember</em> reading) things were a little less&mldr; colonial
in BC than elsewhere in Canada, at least until people from out east came and
demanded an approach more like what they were doing.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Though tonally a bit inappropriate, I&rsquo;d like to share this <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/hehckh/the_starlight_tour/>surprisingly beautifully rendered comic</a>

an alarming rise in antisemitism, an open genocide&mldr;<br>And an <em>upsetting</em> amount of people displaying how easy it is to sympathize with
fascism.</p><p>As long as I&rsquo;ve been politically aware, Israel has been&mldr; a complicated topic.
On the one hand, yes there&rsquo;s a lot of antisemitism in the world even today, and
it&rsquo;s good to have a country where people can go that&rsquo;s made so that they don&rsquo;t
have to worry about it. On the other hand, well&mldr;
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba>it&rsquo;s not like that land was free for use.</a></p><p>In modern Israel, there&rsquo;s still rampant prejudice against Palestinians today.
In fact, a lot of people from Israel don&rsquo;t see Palestinians as being as <em>human</em>
as they are (and vice versa,) which is&mldr; a troubling reflection of the values
instilled by their culture. It&rsquo;s how so much violence is justified. Palestinian
families are kicked out of their houses to make room for new settlers to move
in, they get put in open-air concentration camps where a population of 2 million
is forced to live in an area only 3 times bigger than Vancouver&mldr;</p><p>And oh yeah, the genocide.</p><p>Genocide is not a hard thing to hate, nor is it difficult to denounce. Here,
watch: Genocide is bad. That took three words. Three words to get across a
<em>very</em> basic thought that should be basically universally agreed upon, right?
Well, apparently it&rsquo;s not quite so simple. A lot of people think that if the
victims of the genocide are part of a group they don&rsquo;t like, then it&rsquo;s fine!
At least, apparently that&rsquo;s what people think. The alternative is they still
think genocide is bad, they just don&rsquo;t think this is a genocide, which <em>OH HEY
IS THAT ONE OF THE KEY DEFENCES BEING USED FOR THIS GENOCIDE WOW WHAT A WILD
COINCIDENCE.</em></p><p>Saying that <em>this</em> genocide in particular is bad will frequently result in a few
things:</p><ol><li>Getting called anti-semitic (even if you&rsquo;re Jewish)</li><li>Being called a Nazi (because apparently denouncing the actions taken by a
Jewish country is the same as believing they should be subjected to a
genocide.)</li><li>Having a <em>lot</em> of people explain why this &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> a genocide.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>Now, how <em>anyone</em> can defend this is beyond me, the IDF has been <em>proudly</em>
posting pictures of their actions, and the conditions in Gaza are <em>very</em> well
documented.</p><p>What this shows is actually a bit of a quickie fascism litmus test. How
susceptible are you to fascist ideals and talking points? How willing are you to
turn a blind eye to atrocities? How much will you defend them?</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying everyone who&rsquo;s against Israel is passing the test. Far from
it. In fact, a lot of people are against Israel because they were already
far-right in their leanings. What I <em>am</em> saying is that anyone who can find any
way to justify a genocide in their mind, whether it be by saying that &ldquo;they
deserve it&rdquo;, claiming it isn&rsquo;t a genocide, or whatever else, is quite obviously
susceptible to fascist sympathies.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t care if a genocide is against pedophiles, <em>it&rsquo;s still genocide, and so</em>
<em>I&rsquo;m still against it unconditionally.</em> Having any way to justify it in your
mind means that if a fascist regime took over, if they said the right things to
you, you wouldn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>You are not immune to propaganda. Don&rsquo;t forget that.</p><div class=prev-next-post-links><span class=next-post><a class=link-reverse href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/04/20/yaufyaitg/?ref=footer">&lt;- YAUFYAITG</a>

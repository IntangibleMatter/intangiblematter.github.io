Yet Another Internet Trans Girl, and this post is exactly what it says on the
tin.
I have some posts about
my previous
gender questioning
on this page, so it&rsquo;s not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn&rsquo;t read the
previous posts: I&rsquo;m gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend
a ton of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was
a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time
moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier,
etc, etc, etc.

<a href=https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/23/eggs-like-russian-dolls/>gender questioning</a>
on this page, so it&rsquo;s not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn&rsquo;t read the
previous posts: I&rsquo;m gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend
a <em>ton</em> of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was
a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time
moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier,
etc, etc, etc.</p><p>After a long day, I&rsquo;ll cuddle my Bl√•haj, play some Celeste (or program), listen
to some Underscores or Femtanyl, sometimes <em>wear a fucking Celeste Skirt</em>,
browse trans subreddits, and look at the trans flag on my wall. I will do <em>all</em>
of this, then have the <em>gall</em> to say &ldquo;Still cis tho.&rdquo;</p><p>Point is I&rsquo;m barely holding on to being cis. I think I&rsquo;m just scared not to be
because of two reasons:</p><ol><li>I don&rsquo;t like not being certain of things</li><li>Holy shit society hates trans people right now this is terrifying.</li></ol><p>So y&rsquo;know&mldr; not necessarily the <em>best</em> position to be questioning my gender in,
even if I&rsquo;m in a relatively safe place with a supportive family. It&rsquo;s&mldr; I&rsquo;m not
sure how to say it.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been questioning since I was 12 (at <em>least</em>), but lately it&rsquo;s all just
been&mldr; harder to ignore. Some of it was internal, but over the last year some
other stuff happened that also has made thinking about my gender&mldr; <em>much</em>
harder to avoid.</p><p>First was my first major breakup. No, I will not be talking about it in detail.
I wasn&rsquo;t avoiding questioning because they would judge me (my ex is, themselves,
Gender Non-Conforming), but because I was being a stupid emotionally distant
little 17 year old shit like so many teenage boys are.</p><p>Second has just been uncovering&mldr; how <em>much</em> of myself strongly associated with
trans culture in so many ways. This is a meme I posted in April of last year.
<img src=/media/2024/03/cisguyrelatable.webp alt="A meme with a dog awkwardly trying to blend in with ducks. The ducks are labelled &rsquo;trans people&rsquo;, and the dog is labelled &lsquo;me, a cis guy, here for the suspiciously relatable memes. The water they are all in is labelled r/egg_irl&rsquo;"><p class=caption>still cis tho</p></p><p>Here&rsquo;s an abridged list of other trans-associated things I associate with:</p><ul><li>Celeste</li><li>Bl√•haj</li><li>Hyperpop<ul><li>100 Gecs</li><li>underscores</li><li>femtanyl</li></ul></li><li>constantly thinking about what it would be like to be the other gender</li><li>mostly having friends not of my AGAB</li><li>being &ldquo;just a really passionate ally&rdquo;<ul><li>passionate enough to have a trans flag on the wall</li></ul></li></ul><p>Again, <em>far</em> from a complete list. Barely scraping the surface here.</p><p>So why not just bite the bullet and come out and say it definitively and
explicitly? Because even though the odds are <em>very</em> good, I just&mldr; don&rsquo;t like
declaring things to be true when they aren&rsquo;t, which makes talking about (and
even just <em>understanding</em>) my own feelings incredibly hard. Also&mldr; jesus
<em>christ</em> what the fuck is going on politically right now??? Half the states are
basically trying to ban trans people, but I live in Canada, so I should be
safe, right? Well I would <em>hope</em> so but at the same time we have the leader of
the Conservatives spouting anti-trans bullshit, and the premier of the province
next to mine <em>taking selfies with Tucker fucking Carlson</em>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m fine. I feel fine. I live in a place that&rsquo;s actually pretty safe as far as
this goes.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have any support, either. Most of my good friends
throughout my teenage years have been on <em>some</em> level of genderfuckery.
But the one I want to talk about briefly here is one I only met in the past
year; Talia.</p><p>Talia is a game developer who has some <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40625597>experience under her belt</a>.
I met her at a game development thing last year without knowing her work, and
she apparently almost <em>immediately</em> clocked me as trans-questioning. Candidly,
she&rsquo;s a lot of what I want to be. A successful indie dev making cool shit and
living in a very authentically <em>her</em> way, even if that&rsquo;s working on her games
until ungodly hours of the morning. Which, candidly, so do I.</p><p>She&rsquo;s also one of the most iconic people I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p><p>At one gamedev event I was following her around like a duckling, and
would occasionally make comments about trans subjects that were, shall we say,
<em>very</em> eggy. So after a few hours of this, Talia sits me down, gives me a bunch
of genuinely good advice about being trans, and when I say that I&rsquo;m just an egg
she replies with a statement that I think about literally every day:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Buddy, there&rsquo;s yolk all over the floor.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Anyways yeah she&rsquo;s great love her check out her games can&rsquo;t wait for Clown Meat
etc, etc, etc.</p><p>There&rsquo;s so many signs.</p><p>But I&rsquo;m still so scared and unsure.</p><p>The world is such a scary place, <a href=https://www.tumblr.com/welldrawnfish/731369978218119168/do-you-know-what-its-like-to-be-trans><em>especially</em> for trans people</a>
and right now I&rsquo;m overwhelmed just trying to finish high school.</p><p>Do I feel so out of place as myself because I&rsquo;m trans or is it because I&rsquo;m
autistic?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p><p>Maybe.</p></div><div class=prev-next-post-links><span class=next-post><a class=link-reverse href="https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2024/05/01/who-cares-if-i-end-up-on-the-no-fly-list/?ref=footer">&lt;- Who Cares If I End Up on the No-Fly List</a>
